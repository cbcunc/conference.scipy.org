conference.scipy.org
====================

This repository contains the landing page for
[conference.scipy.org](https://conference.scipy.org).  Each conference manages
its own website. This site is only meant to capture the commonalities between
them.

## Quick Set Up

In a Python virtual environment, install dependencies:

```
$ make init
```

Build the site. The output will be in the `output/` directory.

```
$ make html
```

To view the site locally:

```
$ make serve
< open browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000 >
( you should see your test page in the News and archives )
< Ctrl-C to exit server on terminal >
```


## Adding and Editing Items

The website is a set of static pages generated by
[Pelican](http://getpelican.org) from Markdown files. The content is published
automatically to GitHub Pages every time a pull request is merged to the `main`
branch.

News items in `content/news` are published on the News pages. The format looks like this:

```
$ cd content/news
$ cat << EOF > 2024-03-05-test.md
> Title: Test
> Date: 2024-03-05
> Comments: true
> Categories: 
> Author: Ze Claw <ze.claw@example.com>
> Summary: Testing
> 
> Testing how this works!
> 
> EOF
```

Pages in `content/pages` map to top-level menu items as defined in
`pelicanconf.py`.

After adding or making changes to an item, regenerate the site:

```
< Ctrl-C to exit server on the terminal if it's already running >
$ make html && make serve
```

## Edit the Home Page and the Layout

The layout is defined in the `theme/` folder.

```
$ ls theme
tuxlite_zfs
```

## Update Dependencies

There's a Make target to update dependencies:

```
$ make update-deps
```

It'll read dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and update the `requirements.txt`
file with the latest version.
